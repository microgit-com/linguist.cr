# v0.2

* Added settings support to set path to the languages.yml file - noted issues when adding this as a plugin to another project. This will make it easier. - Look at the readme for setup instructions.
* Cleaned up the code, and only throwing around the Linguist classes instead of the Git classes.
* Smaller memory usage.
* Tested and confirmed working with crystal version 0.34
